## Features
The app contains two agents: the ðŸ¦‰ Wizard ðŸ¦‰ and the ðŸ”® Witch ðŸ”®. It's mainly for personal use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for classes...

### ðŸ¦‰ Wizard ðŸ¦‰
TODO: insert demo

- Request an action to be done to your current directory. The wizard will execute the corrseponding command for you.
- Examples of requests: 
  - List the files that were created after September 22, 2022.
  - Replace all instances of "witch" in ./sorcery with "wizard".
  - etc.

### ðŸ”® Witch ðŸ”®
TODO: insert demo

- Ask the witch a question about the contents of the files in your current directory. The witch will intelligently answer your question using the knowledge obtained from your files.
- Note: as of now, only markdown features are supported.
- Examples of questions (given the directory contains notes about [computational photography](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs445/fa2023/)):
  - What did the professor say are the tradeoffs between Lagrangian vs Eulerian motion magnification in videos?
  - How does Laplacian pyramid blending work?
  - Which of the following properties apply to affine transformations? [...]
  - etc.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo
2. Store your [Open AI key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-api-key) as an environment variable called `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Add an alias for `/src/main.py` to your `.bashrc` so that you can call Sapphire from any directory
  1. For me, this looked like `alias sapphire='python [my_path]/sapphire/src/main.py'`
4. `cd` into the cloned repo and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
